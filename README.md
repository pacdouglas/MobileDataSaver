# WiFiReminder
A simple APP to send you a reminder when you're using too much mobile data.

You know when you forget to turn WiFi on and keep using mobile data without even noticing? Then you realize you used all your quota and still have a full month ahead of you...

Well monitor your mobile data usage. If we notice a high usage in a small period of time, we will notify you that it's better to use WiFi.

It's just click the button to activate the background service and leave it all with us! 

Oh, and you can relax! We only monitor just how much your mobile data usage, your privacy is preserved. =)

**How the calculation works:**
If you are using Internet by data mobile, every 2 minutes a comparison is made with 2 minutes ago in data usage, if in that time period was spent more than 5MB, a notification is sent.
