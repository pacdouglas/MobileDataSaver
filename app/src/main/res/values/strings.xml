    <string name="description">You know when you forget to turn WiFi on and spend your mobile data without even noticing it? Then you realize you used all your quota and still have a full month ahead of you.. We bring you a solution: \nWe\'ll monitor your mobile data usage. If we notice a high usage in a short period of time, we will notify you that it is better to use WiFi. \nJust click the button to activate the background service and leave it all with us!(You can leave the application closed) \n\nOh, and you can relax! We only monitor your mobile data usage, your privacy is preserved. =) (Source code is available on GitHub)</string>
